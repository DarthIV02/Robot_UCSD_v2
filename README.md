### Sidebar

The sidebar is an accordeon-type collection of blocks which are distributed in 3 groups:
* Non-Verbal: which include all of the actions that can be performed by the robot
  *  Body Gestures: Movements performed by the body of the robot
  *  Facial Expressions: Animations that can be presented in the screen of the robot
* Verbal: Which include all of the possible sounds that the robot can say through the speaker
* Actions: Previous curated routines

If you have doubts about a particular block, you can hover over any block and a small description is shown. And when right-clicking on an action block, a menu of options will display:
* Delete: Erases that routine from the current view and database
* Download: Will download the yaml file of that particular routine
* Modify: Will open a new tab with that rutine displayed
